An attack on your email company can reveal your email, leaving your email exposed to people where they can send viruses. Getting
emails filled with viruses can infect your computer and therefore your information that was stored on your computer can be revealed and 
stolen. If you are signed up on a website that doesn't have the "s" in https, your info can be stolen if that website is hacked.
