Cat decided that she needed money to pay her rent. She worked at a cafe and doesnt get paid enough so she did her research and 
looked for a person who didn't have an instagram. She set up an instagram acoount using a persons twitter photos, she now is a person 
named Carley. A guy named Kevin came across her page and wanted to talk to her because he thought that she looked attractive. After weeks 
of talking Kevin thought  that he could trust carley. Since Cat needed the money for rent fast she asked for kevins bank account info. 
Kevin trusted Carley and gave her the info, so then Cat used the info and withdrew money from his account to pay for her rent. Now that she
has all this info she decides to withdraw even more and Kevin ended up with thousands of dollars in debt. Carley decided to stop talking to 
Kevin and Cat decided to Catfish more guys with her scam. This is an example of Catfishing.
